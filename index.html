          Voter turnout in the 2018 Texas midterm elections increased by 18
          percentage points compared with the previous midterms but still lagged
          behind most other states.

          The Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990. It is a civil
          rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.
          The law imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations,
          including public toilets.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          In New York City, there are 616 public toilets in public parks across
          five boroughs and only 129 are handicap accessible. In Brooklyn, there
          are 142 public toilets in public parks-the most of any borough-but the
          most number of handicap accessbile public toilets are in Manhattan, a
          total of 29.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The least number of handicap accessible public toilets in public parks
          are in Staten Island, but Staten Island also has the least number of
          public parks. It is also the only borough with fewer public parks than
          handicap accessible public toilets-18 parks with 20 handicap
          accessible public toilets.

          This scatterplot attempts to show a correlation between handicap
          accessible toilets in public parks and neighborhood wealth.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The Upper Westside has the greatest number of handicap accessible
          toilets in its public parks, with 11 handicap accessible toilets. The
          median income of the area is $117,421.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          By comparison, Lower Manhattan (PUMA 3810) has the highest median
          income of $140,213, but the least number of handicap accessible
          toilets. Lower Manhattan has only one handicap accessible toilet.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The South Bronx (PUMA 3710) has the lowest median income of $24,849
          and is thus the least wealthiest neighborhood in New York City.
          However, it has 4 handicap accessible toilets - 2 at St. Mary's Park
          and Recreation Center, 1 at Millbrook Playground and 1 at Captain
          Rivera Playground.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The concentration of handicap accessible toilets in the Upper Westside
          can be attributed to the fact that many of these toilets are in
          Central Park, the fifth-largest urban park in New York City and the
          most visited park in the United States of America. Both the Upper
          Westside and Central Park belong to the same Public Use Microdata
          Area.
